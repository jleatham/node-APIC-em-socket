This project allows for the access of any publicly available APIC-EM server.  APIC-EM is a Cisco SDN controller that provides APIs for Cisco networking equipment.  APIC-EM comes with it's own GUI, but this project allows more detailed control of which APIs to call.  It can be modified to be used by companies to glean customized networking info and put it into their own workflow.
